description: >-
  Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected. The bounding box is provided as four numbers:

  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2

  For WGS84 longitude/latitude this is in most cases the sequence of
  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).
