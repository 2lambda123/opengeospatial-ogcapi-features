== Conventions

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this standard are denoted by the URI `http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0`.

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base.

=== UML model

UML diagrams are included in this standard to illustrate the conceptual model that underpins implementations of OGC API Features. The UML model is not normative. The UML profile used is specified in ISO 19103:2015.

Resources are modeled as UML interfaces.

=== Link relations

To express relationships between resources, <<rfc8288,RFC 8288 (Web Linking)>> and <<link-relations,registered link relation types>> are used.

=== Use of HTTPS

For simplicity, this document in general only refers to the HTTP protocol. This is not meant to exclude the use of HTTPS and simply is a shorthand notation for "HTTP or HTTPS". In fact, most servers are expected to use <<rfc2818,HTTPS>>, not <<rc2616,HTTP>>.

=== HTTP URIs

This document does not restrict the lexical space of URIs used in the API beyond the requirements of the <<rc2616,HTTP>> and <<rc3986,URI Syntax>> IETF RFCs. If URIs include reserved characters that are delimiters in the URI subcomponent, these have to be percent-encoded. See Clause 2 of <<rfc3986,RFC 3986>> for details.

=== API definition

==== General remarks

Good documentation is essential for every API so that developers can more easily
learn how to use the API. In the best case, documentation will be available in
HTML and in a format that can be processed by software to connect to the API.

This standard specifies requirements and recommendations for APIs that
share feature data and that want to follow a standard way of doing so.
In general, APIs will go beyond the requirements and recommendations
stated in this standard - or other parts of the Web Feature Service
standard series - and will support additional operations, parameters, etc.
that are specific to the API or the software tool used to implement the API.

==== Role of OpenAPI

This document uses OpenAPI 3.0 fragments as examples and to formally state
requirements. However, using OpenAPI 3.0 is not required for implementing a
server.

Therefore, the _Core_ requirements class only requires that an API
definition is provided at path `/api`.

A separate requirements class is specified for API definitions that follow the
<<rc_oas,OpenAPI specification 3.0>>. This does not preclude that in the
future or in parallel other versions of OpenAPI or other API descriptions are
provided by a server.

NOTE: This approach is used to avoid lock-in to a specific approach to
defining an API as it is expected that the API landscape will continue to
evolve.

In this document, fragments of OpenAPI definitions are shown in <<YAML,YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)>> since YAML is easier to read than JSON and is typically used in OpenAPI editors. YAML is described by its authors as a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

==== References to OpenAPI components in normative statements

Some normative statements (requirements, recommendations and permissions) use
a phrase that a component in the API definition of the server must be
"based upon" a schema or parameter component in the OGC schema repository.

In this case, the following changes to the pre-defined OpenAPI component
are permitted:

* If the server supports an XML encoding, `xml` properties may be added to
the relevant OpenAPI schema components.
* The range of values of a parameter or property may be extended (additional
values) or constrained (if a subset of all possible values are applicable
to the server). An example for a constrained range of values is to explicitly
specify the supported values of a string parameter or property using an enum.
* Additional properties may be added to the schema definition of a Response Object.
* Informative text may be changed or added, like comments or description properties.

For API definitions that do not conform to the <<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0>>
the normative statement should be interpreted in the context of the
API definition language used.

==== Paths in OpenAPI definitions

All paths in an OpenAPI definition are relative to a base URL of the server.

.URL of the OpenAPI definition
===========================================
If the OpenAPI Server Object looks like this:

[source,YAML]
----
servers:
  - url: https://dev.example.org/
    description: Development server
  - url: https://data.example.org/
    description: Production server
----

The path "/mypath" in the OpenAPI definition of a Web API would be the
URL `https://data.example.org/mypath` for the production server.
===========================================

==== Reusable OpenAPI components

Reusable components for OpenAPI definitions for implementations of OGC API Features
are referenced from this document.

CAUTION: During the development phase, these components use a base URL of
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/",
but during publication they will move to a base URL of
"http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/".
