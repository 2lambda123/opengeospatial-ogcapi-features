^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/core/fc-bbox-response* 
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the bounding box query parameters are processed corrrectly.
^|Requirement |/req/core/fc-bbox-response
^|Test Method |. Verify that only features that have a spatial geometry that intersects the bounding box are returned as part of the result set.
. Verify that the `bbox` parameter matched all features in the collection that were not associated with a spatial geometry.
. Verify that the bounding box was provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

. Verify that if the bounding box consisted of four numbers then the coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate reference system was specified in a parameter `bbox-crs`.
