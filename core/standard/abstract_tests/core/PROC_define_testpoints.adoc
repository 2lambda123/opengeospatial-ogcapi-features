^|*Abstract Test Suite {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/core/root-op* 
^|Test Purpose |Identification of the test points is a pre-condition to performing a compliance test.
^|A |To identify the test points associated with each Path in the OpenAPI document
^|Process | 
 FOR EACH paths property in the OpenAPI document
 
    If the path name is one of those specified in the WFS 3.0 specification
        Retrieve the Server URIs using A.4.3.2.
        FOR EACH Server URI
            Concatenate the Server URI with the path name to form a test point.
            Add that test point to the list.
            
^|B |To identify all server URIs applicable to an OpenAPI Operation Object
^|Process |1) Identify the Server Objects which are in-scope for this operation

 - IF Server Objects are defined at the Operation level, then those and only those Server Objects apply to that Operation.

 - IF Server Objects are defined at the Path Item level, then those and only those Server Objects apply to that Path Item.

 - IF Server Objects are not defined at the Operation level, then the Server Objects defined for the parent Path Item apply to that Operation.

 - IF Server Objects are not defined at the Path Item level, then the Server Objects defined for the root level apply to that Path.

 - IF no Server Objects are defined at the root level, then the default server object is assumed as described in the OpenAPI specification.

2) Process each Server Object using A.4.3.3.

3) Delete any Server URI which does not reference a server on the list of servers to test.
