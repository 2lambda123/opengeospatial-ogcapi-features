^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/core/fc-md-extent* 
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the `extent` property if it is present
^|Requirement |<<req_core_fc-md-extent,/req/core/fc-md-extent>>
^|Test Method |. Verify that the `extent` provides bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries
. Verify that if the `extent` provides time intervals that include all temporal geometries in this collection. 
. A temporal extent of `null` indicates an open time interval.
