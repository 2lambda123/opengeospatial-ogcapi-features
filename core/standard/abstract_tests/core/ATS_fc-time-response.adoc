^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/fc-time-response*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the datetime query parameters are evaluated correctly.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_fc-time-definition,/req/core/fc-time-definition>>, <<req_core_fc-time-response,/req/core/fc-time-response>>
^|Test Method |Send requests with all variations described in <<req_core_fc-time-response,/req/core/fc-time-response>>: a date-time value, a bounded interval, a half-bounded interval at the start and a half-bounded interval at the end. Use both double-dot and the empty string for the half-bounded values.

. Verify that only features that have a temporal geometry that intersects the temporal information in the `datetime` parameter were included in the result set.
. Verify that all features in the collection that are not associated with a temporal geometry are included in the result set.
