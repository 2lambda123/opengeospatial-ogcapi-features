|===

Note that in the case of GMLSF0/GMLSF2 it is not sufficient to validate against
link:http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/gml.xsd[gml.xsd] as the feature will
be defined in a GML application schema. Determine the XML Schema Document for
the namespace of the feature to validate the XML document.
