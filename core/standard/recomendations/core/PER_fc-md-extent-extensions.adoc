The Core only specifies requirements for spatial and temporal extents.
However, the `extent` object MAY be extended with additional members
to represent other extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges.

The Core only supports spatial extents in WGS 84 longitude/latitude and
temporal extents in the Gregorian calendar (these are the only enum values in
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/[extent.yaml]).
Extension to the Core MAY add additional reference systems to the
`extent` object.
