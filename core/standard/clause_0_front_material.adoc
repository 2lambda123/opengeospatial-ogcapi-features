[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Web Feature Service (WFS) offers the capability to create, modify and query spatial data on the Web. By default, every WFS provides access to a single dataset. Rather than sharing the data as a complete dataset, WFS offers direct, fine-grained access to the data at the feature (object) level.

Consistent with the architecture of the Web, this version of WFS uses a resource architecture and specifies a RESTful service interface consistent with the HTTP/HTTPS standards.

WFS is a multi-part standard. This part specifies the core capabilities that every WFS supports. Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified in additional parts. Examples include support for updating data, more complex data models or richer queries.

This International Standard specifies discovery and query operations.

Discovery operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the dataset. This includes the OpenAPI 3.0 definition of the service as well as metadata about the feature collections provided by the service.

Query operations allow features or values of feature properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon constraints, defined by the client, on feature properties.

This part of this International Standard defines the following resources:

* Service definition [1]
* Feature collections metadata [1]
* Feature collection [0..n]
* Feature [0..n]

*OGC Declaration*

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium Inc. shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
