== Requirement Class "Core"

////
for now, normative statements are often included inline. This will be re-factored later.
////

NOTE: TODO +
Add intro text for the requirement class.

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

=== API definition

Every WFS is defined by an API definition that describes the capabilities
of the server and which can be used by clients to connect to the server or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

include::requirements/requirement_api-definition.adoc[]

The API definition document is the "landing page" point" for the API. I.e.,
there is no need to include the `/api` operation in the API definition itself.

=== HTTP 1.1

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/http +

The server SHALL conform to <<rfc2616,HTTP 1.1>>.
|===

This includes the correct use of status codes, headers, etc.

=== Web caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional
requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

[[rec_etag]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/etag +

The service SHOULD support entity tags and the associated headers as
specified by HTTP/1.1.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add an example OpenAPI operation (headers, response codes). Here or in clause 9.

=== Support for cross-origin requests

To access data from a HTML page where the data is on another host than
the webpage is by default prohibited for security reasons ("same-origin policy").
A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from
multiple distributed datasets.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cross-origin +

If the server is intended to be accessed from the browser, cross-origin
requests SHOULD be supported. Note that support can also be added in a
proxy layer on top of the server.
|===

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

////
==== Support for JSONP

JSONP  ("JSON with padding") is a convenient and popular method to overcome
cross-domain restrictions. Cross-domain resources are loaded through script
injection.

[[rec_jsonp]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/jsonp +

If a request includes the parameter `f` with the value `json` and a
parameter `callback`, the response SHOULD be `{callbackValue}({originalJSONResponse});``
where `{callbackValue}` is the value of the parameter `callback` in the request
and `{originalJSONResponse}` the result of the request, if the callback parameter
had been omitted. The HTTP status code of the response SHOULD be '200'.
|===

I.e., the client may make the request with a special callback parameter and the
server responds with a JSON padded response that looks like:

```
 {callbackValue}({original_json_response});
```

NOTE:	One of the inconveniences of using JSONP is that the server always needs
to respond with an HTTP status of 200. Otherwise the browserâ€™s network stack
rejects the response from the server, and the client callbacks are never
even called. To overcome this, the errors  should be wrapped inside the
response for requests with the `callback` parameter.

==== Support for CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a draft W3C specification that defines
ways for a web server to allow its resources to be accessed by a web page from
a different domain.

[[rec_cors]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cors +

The service SHOULD meet all requirements of the CORS specification related
to resource authors.
|===

For example, a conforming implementation should support the configuration of
origins that are allowed to access resources of a GeoServices REST API service.
If a client submits a request using a "Origin" header that is in the list of
origin, the response will include a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header
with the value of the Origin header. See the CORS specification for details.

////

=== Encodings / Parameter f

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/12[ISSUE 12] +
Proposal to drop f and define separate operations using file extensions
instead, i.e. `/buildings`, `/buildings.json`, `/buildings.xml` and
`/buildings.html`. This is clearer and avoids a conflict with content
negotiation.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/param-f +

All operations SHALL support a parameter `f` with the following
characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
schema:
  type: string
----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/param-f-values +

The API definition SHALL enumerate the list of values of parameter `f`
supported by the server.
|===

.Values for the `f` parameter in an OpenAPI definition
=================
[source,YAML]
----
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - json
    - xml
    - html
----
=================

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/param-f-predef +

The parameter `f` SHALL determine the format of the response. If no value is
provided, the standard HTTP rules SHALL apply, i.e., the accept header is
used to determine the format.

`json` / `xml` / `html` are reserved values and SHALL return the first
JSON / XML / HTML media type listed in the API definition. If no such
media type is included in the API definition, the service MAY determine
the format of the response or respond with HTTP status code `415`.

If other values are provided, the service MAY determine the format of the response.
|===

See <<encodings,Encodings>> for requirements classes for some formats.

See <<mediatypes,Media Types>> for guidance on media types.

[[rec_html]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/html +

To support browsing a WFS with a web browser and to enable search engines to crawl
and index a dataset, implementations SHOULD consider to support an HTML encoding.
|===

A template for the definition of the parameter `f` in YAML according to OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/f.yaml[f.yaml].

=== Link headers

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/link-header +

Links included in payload of responses SHOULD also be included
as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>.

This recommendation does not apply, if there are a large number of links
included in a response or a link is not known when the HTTP headers of the
response are created.
|===

=== Feature collection metadata

==== Operation

include::requirements/requirement_fc-md-op.adoc[]

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.

The content of that response SHALL be based upon the OpenAPI 3.0 schema link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/content.yaml[content.yaml].
|===

That schema supports both JSON and XML responses:

|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-md-descriptions +

If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide
information about the structure or semantics of the data, a "200"-response
SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property
of the response (relation: `describedBy`).

The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link.

This applies to resources that describe to the whole dataset. For
resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the
links SHOULD be set in the `links` property of the appropriate
object in the `collections` resource.

Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema,
RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.

.Feature collection metadata response document
=================
This feature collection metadata example response in JSON is for a dataset with
a single collection "buildings". It includes links to the collection resource in all formats that
are supported by the service (link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type]: "item").

Representations of the metadata resource in other formats are referenced using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "alternate".

Additional links to a GML application schema for the building data and to
a web page that has additional information about buildings are provided, too, using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "describedBy".

Coordinate reference system information is not provided as the service provides
geometries only in the default system (WGS84 longitude/latitude).

A successful execution of the operation SHALL respond in one of two
ways. It may either generate a complete response containing resources that satisfy the
operation or it may simply generate an empty response container
that indicates the count of the total number of resources that the
operation would return. Which of these two responses is generated is
determined by the value of the optional resultType parameter.

The allowed values for this parameter are `results` and `hits`.

If the value of the resultType parameter is set to `results`, the server
SHALL generate a complete response document containing resources that
satisfy the operation.

If the value of the resultType attribute is set to `hits`, the server
SHALL generate an empty response document containing no resource
instances.

If the parameter is not provided, `results` is used.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-filters +

If features in the feature collection include a feature property that has a
simple value (for example, a string or integer) that is expected to be useful
for applications using the service to filter the features of the collection
based on this property, you SHOULD support a parameter with the name of the
feature property and with the following characteristics (using an
OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - residential
    - commercial
    - public use
style: form
explode: false
example: 'function=public+use'
----
=================

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links:

* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported
by the service (relation: `alternate`),
* a link to the previous "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided
with a value `i` with `i > 0` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the
parameter `count` (relation: `prev`).
* a link to the next "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided with
a value `i` with `i + c < f` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the
parameter `count` and `f` is the number of features in the collection (relation: `next`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
If the request is to return features from the 51st feature, using the default value of the `count` parameter "10", the links in the response could be (in this example represented as link headers):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=xml&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"

Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=60>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

If an explicit `count` of "50" is used, the links in the response could be:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
TODO +
Add normative statements for the following information in the response:

* timeStamp: Indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
* numberMatched: The number of features of the feature type that match the
selection parameters like `bbox` or additional filter parameters.
* numberReturned: If the value is provided, the value shall be identical to the number
of items in the "features" array. A server may omit this information in a response,
if the information about the number of features is not known or difficult to compute.
If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "hits",
the value shall be set to "0", if provided.
=====================================================================

CAUTION: Related to link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Define these as headers or include them in the payload? `timeStamp`, for example, does
not seem to be needed given the 'Date' HTTP header. For `numberMatched` and
`numberReturned` headers do not seem to be a good idea as, for example,
`numberReturned` can only be included at the end, if streaming is used.

=== Feature

==== Operation

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-op +

For every feature in a feature collection (path "/{collectionId}"),
the service SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path `/{collectionId}/{id}`.

`collectionId` is the property of the same name in the feature collection metadata.

`id` is the unique identifier of the feature within the dataset.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add more about the feature identifiers.

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links in the response:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`), and
* a link to the feature collection that contains this feature (relation: `collection`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
The links in a feature could be (in this example represented as link headers):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings/123?f=json>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings/123?f=xml>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings/123?f=html>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json>; rel="collection"; type="application/geo+json"
----

Dictionary tables for requirements can be added as necessary. Modify the following example as needed.
