=== OpenAPI definition

Every WFS is defined by an link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].
That document describes the capabilities of the service and can be used by tools to support the
implementation of servers and clients.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/7[ISSUE 7] +
It seems to be rather uncommon to include an operation in
an OpenAPI definition that returns an OpenAPI document. +
Proposal: Simply require that the OpenAPI definition is available at /api,
but drop the example and exclude the /api operation from all other examples, too.

=== HTTP status codes

This document specifies link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Objects]
for the regular, successful execution of an operation as well as for error situations that originate from the service implementation (see the sub-clause <<exceptions,Exceptions>>).

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Permission {counter:per-id} |/per/core/http-codes +

A service may specify additional link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#httpCodes[HTTP Status Codes]
in a link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Object].
|===

Typical cases for this are services that are access-controlled (see the
sub-clause <<security,Security>>), web cache validation is supported or
where HTTP redirection is used.

NOTE: TODO +
Check, if the approach is consistent with the security concepts
identified in the upcoming "OGC Web Services Security" standard.

Clients should be prepared to receive responses not documented in the
OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer
outside of the service.

|===

The exception schema supports both JSON and XML encodings:

[[security]]
=== Security

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/security +

For cases, where the operations of the service are access-controlled, the security scheme(s)
SHALL be documented in the OpenAPI definition.
|===

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,
* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
* OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and
* OpenID Connect Discovery.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/10[ISSUE 10] +
If an implementation limits the access to a subset of the operations for some
users (or if the server implements even more fine-grained access), it may no
longer be possible for such a user to de-reference all links, including
relationships between features. Does this require a discussion? Or more?

=== Web caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional
requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

[[rec_etag]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/etag +

The service SHOULD support entity tags and the associated headers as
specified by HTTP/1.1.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add an example OpenAPI operation (headers, response codes).

=== Support for cross-origin requests

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/5[ISSUE 5] +
Servers should support a mechanism to overcome cross-domain restrictions
(CORS and/or JSONP). +
Are recommendations sufficient or should those be requirements?

////
==== Support for JSONP

JSONP  ("JSON with padding") is a convenient and popular method to overcome
cross-domain restrictions. Cross-domain resources are loaded through script
injection.

[[rec_jsonp]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/jsonp +

If a request includes the parameter `f` with the value `json` and a
parameter `callback`, the response SHOULD be `{callbackValue}({originalJSONResponse});``
where `{callbackValue}` is the value of the parameter `callback` in the request
and `{originalJSONResponse}` the result of the request, if the callback parameter
had been omitted. The HTTP status code of the response SHOULD be '200'.
|===

I.e., the client may make the request with a special callback parameter and the
server responds with a JSON padded response that looks like:

```
 {callbackValue}({original_json_response});
```

NOTE:	One of the inconveniences of using JSONP is that the server always needs
to respond with an HTTP status of 200. Otherwise the browserâ€™s network stack
rejects the response from the server, and the client callbacks are never
even called. To overcome this, the errors  should be wrapped inside the
response for requests with the `callback` parameter.

==== Support for CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a draft W3C specification that defines
ways for a web server to allow its resources to be accessed by a web page from
a different domain.

[[rec_cors]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cors +

The service SHOULD meet all requirements of the CORS specification related
to resource authors.
|===

For example, a conforming implementation should support the configuration of
origins that are allowed to access resources of a GeoServices REST API service.
If a client submits a request using a "Origin" header that is in the list of
origin, the response will include a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header
with the value of the Origin header. See the CORS specification for details.

////

=== Encodings / Parameter f

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/12[ISSUE 12] +
Proposal to drop f and define separate operations using file extensions
instead, i.e. `/buildings`, `/buildings.json`, `/buildings.xml` and `/buildings.html`. This is clearer and avoids a conflict with content
negotiation.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/param-f +

All operations SHALL include a

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/param-f-predef +

The parameter `f` SHALL determine the format of the response. If no value is
provided, the standard http rules apply, i.e., the accept header shall be
used to determine the format.

Reserved values are:

* `xml` SHALL return the first XML media type listed in the
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#mediaTypeObject[media types]
of the applicable link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Object]
of the operation. If no XML media type is included, the service MAY determine the format of the response.
* `json` SHALL return the first JSON media type listed in the
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#mediaTypeObject[media types]
of the applicable link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Object]
of the operation. If no JSON media type is included, the service MAY determine the format of the response.
* `html` SHALL return the first HTML media type listed in the
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#mediaTypeObject[media types]
of the applicable link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Object]
of the operation. If no HTML media type is included, the service MAY determine the format of the response.

If other values are provided, the service MAY determine the format of the response.
|===

See <<encodings,Encodings>> for requirements classes for some formats.

See <<mediatypes,Media Types>> for guidance on media types.

[[rec_html]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/html +

To support browsing a WFS with a web browser and to enable search engines to crawl
and index a dataset, implementations SHOULD consider to support an HTML encoding.
|===

A template for the definition of the parameter `f` in YAML is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/f.yaml[f.yaml].

=== Feature collection metadata

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200" based upon the schema link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/content.yaml[content.yaml].
|===

That schema supports both JSON and XML responses:

----

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`),
* links to each feature collection resource in this distribution of the dataset for each supported encoding (relation: `item`), and
* links to the OpenAPI definition document in JSON and HTML (relation: `service`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

[[fc_md_descriptions]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-md-descriptions +

If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide information about the structure or semantics of the data, a "200"-response SHOULD include `Link` headers in the HTTP response to each of those resources according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>> (relation: `describedBy`).

The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link.

This applies to resources that describe to the whole dataset. For resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the links SHOULD be set in the feature collection resource (see <<fc_descriptions,recommendation `/rec/core/fc-descriptions`>>).

Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema, RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.
|===

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Are link headers a problem as the server can only start to write the response
once all links are known? +
If we keep the link headers, do we need something more specific than just
`describedBy` so that the different cases can be distinguished by a client?

NOTE: TODO +
Add recommendation about a link to the distribution resource in the dataset
metadata (example in DCAT). Which link relation type?

==== Parameter resultType

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-resultType-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL include a
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#parameterObject[Parameter Object]
with the name `resultType` and the following properties:

[source,YAML]
----
name: resultType
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - hits
    - results
  default: results
style: form
explode: false
----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-resultType-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL respond to a query in one of two
ways. It may either generate a complete response containing resources that satisfy the
operation or it may simply generate an empty response container
that indicates the count of the total number of resources that the
operation would return. Which of these two responses is generated is
determined by the value of the optional resultType parameter.

The allowed values for this parameter are `results` and `hits`.

If the value of the resultType parameter is set to `results`, the server
SHALL generate a complete response document containing resources that
satisfy the operation.

If the value of the resultType attribute is set to `hits`, the server
SHALL generate an empty response document containing no resource
instances.

If the parameter is not provided, `results` is used.
|===

==== Parameters for filtering on feature properties

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-filters +

If features in the feature collection include a feature property that has a
simple value, for example, a string or integer, that is expected to be useful
for applications using the service to filter the features of the collection
based on this property, you SHOULD include a
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#parameterObject[Parameter Object]
with the name of the feature property and the following properties:

[source,YAML]
----
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
----

The `schema` property SHALL be the same as the definition of the feature
property in the response schema.
|===

.An additional parameter to filter buildings based on their function
=================
[source,YAML]
----
name: function
in: query
description: >-
  Only return buildings of a particular function.\

  Default = return all buildings.
required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - residential
    - commercial
    - public use
style: form
explode: false
example: 'function=public+use'
----
=================

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`),
* a link to the previous "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided with a value `i` with `i > 0` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the  parameter `count` (relation: `prev`).
* a link to the next "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided with a value `i` with `i + c < f` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the  parameter `count` and `f` is the number of features in the collection (relation: `next`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Are link headers a problem as the server can only start to write the response
when it knows whether to include a 'next' relation or not?

.Link headers
=================
If the request is to return features from the 51st feature, using the default value of the `count` parameter "10", the Link headers in the response could be:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=xml&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=html&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=40>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=60>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

If an explicit `count` of "50" is used, the Link headers in the response could be:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=xml&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=html&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=0&count=50>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=100&count=50>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----
=================

////
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-timeStamp +

A "200"-response SHALL include a property `timeStamp` based upon the schema
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[timeStamp.yaml].
|===

The exception schema supports both JSON and XML encodings:

.link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[Schema for the timeStamp property]
[source,YAML]
----
timeStamp:
  description: This property indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
  type: string
  format: dateTime
  example: '2017-08-17T08:05:32Z'
  xml:
    attribute: true
----
////

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
TODO +
Add normative statements for the following information in the response:

* timeStamp: Indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
* numberMatched: The number of features of the feature type that match the
selection parameters like `bbox` or additional filter parameters.
* numberReturned: If the value is provided, the value shall be identical to the number
of items in the "features" array. A server may omit this information in a response,
if the information about the number of features is not known or difficult to compute.
If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "hits",
the value shall be set to "0", if provided.
=====================================================================

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Define these as headers or include them in the payload? `timeStamp`, for example, does
not seem to be needed given the 'Date' HTTP header. For `numberMatched` and
`numberReturned` headers do not seem to be a good idea as, for example,
`numberReturned` can only be included at the end, if streaming is used.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-key-properties +

The schema for the Response Objects SHOULD include key feature properties
of the features in the feature collection.

This is in particular helpful, if filter parameters are defined for the
collection (see recommendation `/rec/core/fc-filters`).
|===

=== Feature

==== Operation

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-op +

For every feature in a feature collection (path "/{collectionId}"),
the service SHALL provide at the path "/{collectionId}/{id}" an operation with a `get`
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#operationObject[Operation Object].

`collectionId` is the property of the same name in the feature collection metadata.

`id` is the unique identifier of the feature within the dataset.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add more about the feature identifiers.

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-success +

HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/f-schema +

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`), and
* a link to the feature collection that contains this feature (relation: `collection`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
