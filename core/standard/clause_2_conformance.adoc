== Conformance
This standard defines a five requirements and conformance classes.

The standardization targets of all conformance classes are "web services".

The main requirements class is:

* <<rc_core,Core>>.

It specifies requirements that all WFS have to meet.

The "Core" does not mandate any encoding or format for representing features or
feature collections. The other four requirements classes depend on the "Core"
and specify representations for the WFS resources in commonly used encodings
for spatial data on the web:

* <<rc_html,HTML>>,
* <<rc_geojson,GeoJSON>>,
* <<rc_gmlsf0,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0>>, and
* <<rc_gmlsf2,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2>>.

None of these encodings is mandatory and an implementation of the "Core"
requirements class may also decide to use none of them, but to use another encoding
instead.

The "Core" is intended to be the minimal useful service interface for fine-grained
access to a spatial dataset.

Additional capabilities, for example, support for transactions, complex data
structures, rich queries, custom coordinate reference systems, etc., may be
specified in future parts of WFS or as vendor-specific extensions.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests
specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and
methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance
are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the
OGC Compliance Testing web site.
