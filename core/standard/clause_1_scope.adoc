== Scope

This International Standard specifies the behaviour of a service that provides access to features in a dataset in a manner independent of the underlying data store. It specifies discovery and query operations.

Discovery operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the dataset. This includes the OpenAPI 3.0 definition of the service as well as metadata about the feature collections provided by the service.

Query operations allow features to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon simple selection criteria, defined by the client.
