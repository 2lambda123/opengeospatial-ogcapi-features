=== A.1: OpenAPI 3.0 Test Suites*
The following test suites shall be used if the service description is provided using OpenAPI 3.0.
[cols=">20h,<80d"width="100%"]
|====================
|A.1.1 API Definition
| a) Test Purpose: Validate that the serivce provides a landing page on the required path
| b) Pre-conditions: Client is aware of the root path to the service
| c) Test Method:
|     1) Client issues a get request on {protocol}://{root_path}/api
|         i) accept header is set to ?????
|     2) Client receives an OpenAPI document in response to the get request
| d) References: Requirement R1
| e) Notes: This operation is usually where the client and server initially authenticate their identities to each other.  Intermediate challenges and responses in support of authentication do not invalidate the results of this test.
