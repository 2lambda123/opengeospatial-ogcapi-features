## About

A draft for part 1 of WFS 3.0 is available. It is basically a complete draft:

* [OGC Web Feature Service 3.0 - Part 1: Core, Editors' draft](https://rawgit.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/docs/17-069.html)
* [First draft release, open issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/milestone/1)
* [Implementations of the draft specification / demo services](implementations.md)
* [Checklist for implementers](guide/conformance_checklist.md)

In addition, a non-normative document, the "WFS 3.0 Users Guide", is planned.

In addition to feedback from the initial implementations as well as discussions on GitHub and in the OGC/ISO working group, 
the current draft of the Core specification has been tested in a [WFS 3.0 Hackathon](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wfs3hackathon).
The release of a first draft version is planned for April and will be used as input for the [OGC Testbed-14](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed14) 
and for the next steps in the standardization process in OGC and ISO/TC 211. The open issues that we plan to address in this version
can be seen in the [milestone information](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/milestone/1).

The current expectation is to have a stable version of the Core specification in early 2019. We want to wait for sufficient 
implementation feedback, mature implementations including a test suite, the results of OGC Testbed-14 and experience with 
draft extensions first.
