The term "temporal data type" is used for the following data types: Timestamp, Date, or Interval.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_temporal-predicates,/req/{conf-class}/temporal-predicates>>, <<req_{conf-class}_temporal-operators,/req/{conf-class}/temporal-operators>>
|Test purpose: | Test the T_AFTER, T_BEFORE, T_DISJOINT, T_EQUALS, T_INTERSECTS operators
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The list of queryables with their data types.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` with a temporal data type, evaluate the following filter expressions

* #TODO#

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* #TODO#
* store the valid expressions for each data source.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | all requirements
|Test purpose: | Test predicates against the test dataset
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The implementation under test uses the test dataset.

When:

Evaluate each predicate in <<test-data-predicates-temporal-operators>>.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the expected result is returned;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
