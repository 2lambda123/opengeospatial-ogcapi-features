|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | all requirements
|Test purpose: | Validate that CQL2 JSON is supported by the server
|Test method: | 
Given:

* A filter expression

When:

Execute conformance tests for all supported conformance classes with the parameter "Filter Language". Use the value "CQL2 JSON". Note that the filter expressions in the test cases have to be converted to a CQL2 JSON representation.

Then:

* assert the validation is successful.
