== Requirements Class "Basic CQL2"

[[basic-cql2-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-cql2.adoc[]

This clause defines the core of a query language called `Common Query Language`
(CQL2) that may be used to construct filter expressions. This core is called Basic CQL2.

Subsequent clauses define additional filtering capabilities as well as several
encodings of CQL2.

[[basic-cql2_filter-expression]]
=== CQL2 filter expression

A CQL2 filter expression is an expression that defines a logically connected
set of predicates that are evaluated for each item of a collection.

A predicate is an expression that evaluates to the Boolean values of `TRUE`
or `FALSE` or that evaluates to the value `NULL` when dealing with unknown
values.

If a predicate evaluates to `TRUE` for an item, the item qualifies for
further processing such as presentation in the result set, being passed on
to the next predicate in the filter for further evaluation, and so forth.

If the predicate evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL` for an item, the item is not
available for further processing.

A collection item that satisfies ALL the requirements of a CQL2 filter expression
evaluates to a Boolean value of `TRUE`; otherwise the CQL2 filter expression
evaluates to `FALSE`.

NOTE: The requirements in the rest of this specification only discuss predicates as evaluating to `TRUE` or `FALSE` and don't explicitly discuss predicates that evaluate to `NULL`.  For the purpose of evaluating a CQL2 filter expression, a query prediate that evaluates to `NULL` (i.e. of unknown value) is essentually the same as one that evaluates to `FALSE`.  That is, its effect is that a collection item being evaluated by the CQL2 filter expression would _not_ be passed on for further evaluation.

include::requirements/basic-cql2/REQ_cql2-filter.adoc[]

Literal values do not have to be supported on the left hand side of predicates and 
property references do not have to be supported on the right hand side of
predicates.

include::recommendations/basic-cql2/PER_cql2-filter.adoc[]

A Basic CQL2 filter expression can be constructed by logically connecting one
or more comparison predicates.

Support for the parts of CQL2 that are not part of Basic CQL2 is added in additional
requirements classes in <<cql2-enhancements>>:

* The rules `isLikePredicate`, `isBetweenPredicate` and `isInListPredicate` are added by requirements class <<rc_advanced-comparison-operators,Advanced Comparison Operators>>;
* Support for the `CASEI` operator is added by requirements class <<rc_case-insensitive-comparison,Case-insensitive Comparison>>;
* Support for the `ACCENTI` operator is added by requirements class <<rc_accent-insensitive-comparison,Accent-insensitive Comparison>>;
* The rule `spatialPredicate` is added by requirements classes <<rc_basic-spatial-operators,Basic Spatial Operators>> and <<rc_spatial-operators,Spatial Operators>>;
* The rule `temporalPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_temporal-operators,Temporal Operators>>.
* The rule `arrayPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_array-operators,Array Operators>>;
* The permission to not support the literal rules on the left hand side of predicates and the rule `propertyName` on the right hand side is removed by requirements class <<rc_property-property,Property-Property Comparisons>>;
* The rule `function` is added by requirements class <<rc_functions,Functions>>;
* The rule `arithmeticExpression` is added by requirements class <<rc_arithmetic,Arithmetic Expressions>>.

Examples of Basic CQL2 filter expressions are included in the subsequent sub-clauses.

[[basic-cql2_data-types-and-literals]]
=== Data types and literal values

This section documents the data types supported by CQL2 and has examples 
of literal values for each data type.

A literal value is any part of an CQL2 filter expression that is used
exactly as it is specified in the expression.

[[scalar-data-types]]
==== Scalar data types

The scalar data types are:

* "string": character strings (literal rule `characterLiteral`);
* "number": numbers including integers and floating point values (literal rule `numericLiteral`);
* "boolean": booleans (literal rule `booleanLiteral`);
* "timestamp": an instant with a granularity of a second or smaller (literal rule: `timestampLiteral`)
* "date": an instant with a granularity of a day (literal rule: `dateLiteral`)

For character string, numeric and boolean literals, the standard representations are used. For character string literals, embeded quotes are escaped using double quotes (i.e. `''`).

Conceptually, an instant is a "temporal entity with zero extent or duration" [<<owl-time,Time Ontology in OWL>>]. In practice, the temporal position of an instant is described using data types where each value has some duration or granularity that is sufficient for the intended use of the data. 

CQL2 supports two commonly used granularities: a second or smaller (data type "timestamp") and days (data type "date"). Literal timestamps are always in the time zone UTC ("Z"), dates are local dates without an associated timezone. 

If timezone information is important for the intended use, then the "date" data type should not be used and the temporal information should be provided as an interval with start and end timestamps.

For timestamp and date values representations based on RFC 3339 are used:

* Text: a `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` operator with a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6[RFC 3339 `date-time` or `full-date` string]
* JSON: an object with a `date` or `timestamp` member with a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6[RFC 3339 `date-time` or `full-date` string]

==== Spatial data types

The spatial data types are (literal rule `spatialLiteral`): 

* "Point": a point;
* "MultiPoint": a collection of points;
* "LineString": a curve with linear interpolation between the vertices;
* "MultiLineString": a collection of line strings;
* "Polygon": a planar surface bounded by closed line strings;
* "MultiPolygon": a collection of polygons;
* "Geometry": an instance of "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", or "MultiPolygon";
* "GeometryCollection": a collection of "Geometry" instances.

For spatial geometries existing representations are used:

* Text: an https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=25355[OGC Well-Known Text (WKT)] literal
* JSON: a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html#section-3.1[GeoJSON geometry] object

      ]
   ]
}

==== Temporal data types 

The temporal data types are "timestamp" and "date" (see <<scalar-data-types>>) as well as "intervals" (rule `temporalLiteral`).

An interval has an start and end instant, which are both included in the interval. Unbounded interval ends are represented by a double-dot string ("..") based on the convention specified in ISO 8601-2.

For intervals, the following representations are used:

* Text: an `INTERVAL` operator with two instants or double-dot strings as parameters;
* JSON: an object with an `interval` member with an array of two instants or double-dot strings as parameters.

In case two instants are provided, both instants have the same granularity (i.e., they are either timestamps or dates).

==== Arrays

An array is a bracket-delimited, comma-separated list of array elements. An array element is either a scalar value,
a geometry, an interval, or another array.

----
====

==== Type casts

include::recommendations/basic-cql2/PER_type-casts.adoc[]

This Standard does not prescribe how types are cast. The evaluation of filter expressions that involve type casts will, therefore, be system dependent.

For example, a system that evaluates the interval `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')` can, for example,

* throw an error (incompatible types in an interval);
* cast the value to an interval of dates, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11')`;
* cast the value to an interval of timestamps, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01Z00:00:00Z','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')`.

[[basic-cql2_property]]
=== Property references

Properties in an object being evaluated in the CQL2 filter expression can be
referenced by their name (rule `propertyName`).

include::requirements/basic-cql2/REQ_property.adoc[]

For example, a property name used in a scalar expression (rule `scalarExpression`)
has to be a queryable of type `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date`, or `timestamp`.
