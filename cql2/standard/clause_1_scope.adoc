== Scope

This document specifies the Common Query Language (CQL2) to express filter expressions on spatial and temporal data.

This document defines

* A text encoding for a CQL2 filter;
* A JSON encoding for a CQL2 filter.

NOTE: The CQL2 grammar contains many language elements of a general purpose, spatio-temporal expression language.
The focus of this version of the language are boolean-valued filter expressions. It is planned to investigate, if CQL2
should be extended through additional functions and operators to evolve into a backward-compatible expression language
that is not restricted to boolean-valued expressions, but support expressions that result in other values, too, including
geometries. Such expressions can be used, for example, in a style language or to define derived properties. In this case,
a new requirements class for boolean-valued filter expressions would be added to the Standard.
