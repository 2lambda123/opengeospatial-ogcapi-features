^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/accent-case-insensitive-comparison/accenti-builtin-function*
^|A |The server SHALL support a built-in function named `ACCENTI`.
^|B |The function SHALL accept one argument that can be a character string literal, the name of a property that evaluates to a character string literal or a function that returns a character string literal (see rules `characterLiteral`, `propertyName`, `function`).
^|C |The function SHALL return a character string literal.
^|D |The function SHALL implement https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/#unicodeNormalization[unicode normalization] described in the implementation guidelines of https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0[The Unicode Standard, Version 14.0] (see https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch05.pdf[clause 5.6 Normalization]).

NOTE: The references in D need to be verified.  Also need to have some discussion about NFC (cacnonically-composed form) or NFD (canonically decomposed form).  I think the correct thing is to say that ACCENTI() must do NFC ... but I need to verify.
