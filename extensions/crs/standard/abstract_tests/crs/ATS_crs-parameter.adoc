^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/crs/crs-parameter*
^|Test Purpose |Verify that the parameter `crs` has been implemented correctly
^|Requirement |<<req_crs_fc-crs-definition,/req/crs/fc-crs-definition>>, <<req_crs_fc-crs-valid-value,/req/crs/fc-crs-valid-value>>, <<req_crs_fc-crs-default-value,/req/crs/fc-crs-default-value>>, <<req_crs_ogc-crs-header,/req/crs/ogc-crs-header>>, <<req_crs_ogc-crs-header-value,/req/crs/ogc-crs-header-value>>, <<req_crs_geojson,/req/crs/geojson>>
^|Test Method |. For each spatial feature collection `collectionId` and every GML or GeoJSON feature representation supported by the Web API, send a request with the parameter `crs` to `/collections/{collectionId}/items` and `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}` (with a valid `featureId` for the collection) for every CRS listed in the `crs` property of the collection or in the global CRS list, if `#/crs` is included in the `crs` property. Verify that every response is a valid Features or Feature response, has the status code `200` and includes a `Content-Crs` http header with the value of the requested CRS identifier.
. For each spatial feature collection, send a request with an value that is not included in the list and verify that the response has status code `400`.
. For each spatial feature collection, send a request without the crs parameter and verify that the response includes a `Content-Crs` http header with the value of the default CRS identifier of the collection.
