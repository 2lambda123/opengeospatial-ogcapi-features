== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,Geospatial API for Features - Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behavior of a server that supports the ability to present geometry valued properties in a response document in one from a list of supported Coordinates Reference Systems (CRS).

Each supported CRS is specified by reference using a uniform resource identifier (URI).

This document specifies:

* How, for each offered feature collection, a server advertises the list of supported CRS identifiers;

* How the coordinates of geometry valued feature properties can be accessed in one of the supported CRSs;

* How features can be accessed from the server using a bounding box specified in one of the supported CRSs; and

* How a server can declare the coordinate reference system used to present feature resources.
