TODO

If a collection includes a property with role „reference“, operations to request features support a parameter „profile“ to select the representation of the reference in the response.

* rel-as-key – the foreign key
* rel-as-uri – the URI of the referenced resource
* rel-as-link – an object with property "href" (the URI) and, optionally, "title" (a human readable label, e.g. for a clickable link)

Discuss negotiation depending on the format
