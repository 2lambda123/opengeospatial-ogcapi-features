[[cql-encodings]]
== Requirements classes for encodings

=== Overview

This clause specifies requirements for a text encoding and a JSON encoding of
Simple CQL.

[[simple-cql-text]] 
=== Requirements Class "Simple CQL Text"

include::requirements/requirements_class_simple-cql-text.adoc[]

This requirements class defines a well know text encoding of Simple CQL. Such
an encoding would be suitable for use with the a GET query parameter such as
<<rc_filter,`filter`>> parameter.

include::requirements/simple-cql-text/REQ_simple-cql-text.adoc[]

[[simple-cql-json]]
=== Requirements Class "Simple CQL JSON"

include::requirements/requirements_class_simple-cql-json.adoc[]

This requirements class defines a JSON encoding of Simple CQL. Such an encoding
would be suitable as the body of an HTTP POST request.

include::requirements/simple-cql-json/REQ_simple-cql-json.adoc[]

NOTE: Attention is drawn to the fact that there exists an alternative JSON encoding for CQL based on the use of arrays that can be found here: https://github.com/tschaub/ogcapi-features/tree/json-array-expression/extensions/cql/jfe.  The SWG will need to review both encodings and decide which one to adopt.
