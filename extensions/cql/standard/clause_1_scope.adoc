== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behaviour of a server that supports
enhanced filtering capabilities expressed using a common query language (CQL).

Enhanced filtering capabilities in this case means that the server supports
the ability to define selection clauses using predicates beyond those supported
by the OGC API Common specification (i.e. bbox and datetime).

This document defines a text encoding for a CQL filter suitable for use as a 
query parameter in a URL.

This document defines a JSON encoding for a CQL filter suitable for use in a 
HTTP POST body.

This document defines the schema for a JSON document that exposes the set of 
properties or keys that may be used to construct CQL expressions.
