== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behaviour of a server that supports
enhanced filtering capabilities expressed using a common query language (CQL).

Enhanced filtering capabilities in this case means that the server supports
the ability to define selection clauses using predicates beyond those supported
by part 1 (i.e., `bbox` and `datetime`).

This document defines

* query parameters for specifying a filter in a request to a Web API;
* a text encoding for a CQL filter suitable for use as a query parameter in a URL;
* a JSON encoding for a CQL filter suitable for use in a HTTP POST body;
* how the set of properties or keys that can be used to construct CQL expressions
("queryables") are published by a Web API.
