^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/arrays/array-predicate*
^|A |The server shall support arrays as defined by the BNF rule `arrayPredicate` in <<cql-bnf>> 
with the exception of the following rules:

* `function` in `arrayExpression`, `arrayElement` and `argument`
* `arithmeticExpression` in `arrayElement` and `argument`.
^|B |Both array expressions SHALL be evaluated as sets. No inherent order SHALL be implied in a array of values.
^|C |The semantics of the array operators SHALL be evaluated as follows:

* `AEQUALS` evaluates to the Boolean value `TRUE`, if both sets are identical; otherwise the predicate 
SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
* `ACONTAINS` evaluates to the Boolean value `TRUE`, if the first set is a superset of the second set; 
otherwise the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
* `CONTAINED BY` evaluates to the Boolean value `TRUE`, if the first set is a subset of the second set; 
otherwise the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
* `AOVERLAPS` evaluates to the Boolean value `TRUE`, if both sets share at least one common element; 
otherwise the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
