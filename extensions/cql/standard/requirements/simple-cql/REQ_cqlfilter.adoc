^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/simple-cql/cqlfilter* 
^|A |A server that implements this conformance class shall support a CQL filter expression composed of a logically connected series of one or more predicates as described by the following BNF fragment:

----
   cqlFilter = booleanValueExpression;

   booleanValueExpression = booleanTerm
                         \| booleanValueExpression "OR" booleanTerm;

   booleanTerm = booleanFactor
              \| booleanTerm "AND" booleanFactor;

   booleanFactor = \["NOT"\] booleanPrimary;

   booleanPrimary = predicate
                 \| leftParen cqlFilter rightParen;

   predicate = comparisonPredicate
            \| spatialPredicate
            \| temporalPredicate;
