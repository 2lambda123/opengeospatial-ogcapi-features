^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/enhanced-temporal-operators* 
^|A |A server that implements this requirements class shall, in addition to `ANYINTERACTS`, support the additional temporal operators defined by the following BNF fragment which extends the list of temporal operators specified for the <<req_simple-cql_temporal-predicates,Simple CQL Temporal Predicates>> requirements class:

----
   temporalOperator = "ANYINTERACTS"
                   \| "BEFORE"
                   \| "AFTER"
