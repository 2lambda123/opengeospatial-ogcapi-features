[[cql-enhancements]]
== Common Query Language enhancements

=== Overview

This clause specifies requirements for enhancements to <<cql-core,Simple CQL>>.
Specifically, this clause defined requirements for:

* additional spatial operators
* additional temporal operators
* support for functions in CQL
* support for arithmetic expression in CQL

In each case, the clause also ammends and extends CQL's BNF and the text and
JSON encodings of CQL to introduce the enhanced capabilities.

=== Requirements Class "Enhanced Spatial Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_enhanced-spatial-operators.adoc[]

The <<rc_simple_cql,Simple CQL>> clause specifies the use of the `INTERSECTS`
spatial operator.  This requirement adds the remaining Dimensionally Extended
Nine-intersection Model (DE-9IM) relation operators to the list of spatial
operators that an implementation of this extension might offer.

include::requirements/enhanced-spatial-operators/REQ_enhanced-spatial-operators.adoc[]

The following table lists the mathematical definitions of each spatial operators
as described in <<ISO19125,OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information - Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>.

[[enhanced-temporal-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Enhanced Temporal Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_enhanced-temporal-operators.adoc[]

The <<rc_simple_cql,Simple CQL>> clause specifies the use of the `ANYINTERACTS`
temporal operator.  This requirements class adds the remaining ISO temporal
operators to the list of temporal operators that an implementations of this
extension might offer.

operator names defined in <<OGC16-071r3,Time Ontology in OWL>>.

[[functions]]
=== Requirements Class "Functions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_functions.adoc[]

This clause specifies requirements for supporting functions in CQL. Functions
allow implementations to extend the language.

A resource, `/functions` is also defined that allows clients to discover the
list of function that an implementation offers.

[[arithmetic]]
=== Requirements Class "Arithmetic Expressions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_arithmetic.adoc[]

This clause specifies requirements for supporting arithmetic expressions in CQL.
An arithemtic expression is an expression composed of an arithmetic operand
(a property name, a number or a function that returns a number), an arithmetic
operator (i.e. one of +,-,*,/) and another arithmetic operand.
