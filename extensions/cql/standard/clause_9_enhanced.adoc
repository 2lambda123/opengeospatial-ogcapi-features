[[cql-enhancements]]
== Common Query Language enhancements

=== Overview

This clause specifies requirements for enhancements to <<cql-core,Simple CQL>>.
Specifically, this clause defines requirements for:

* Additional spatial operators;
* Additional temporal operators;
* Support for functions in CQL;
* Support for arithmetic expression in CQL;
* Support for arrays in CQL.

In each case, this clause specifies requirements for the rules in <<cql-bnf>>
not supported by Simple CQL.

=== Requirements Class "Enhanced Spatial Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_enhanced-spatial-operators.adoc[]

The <<rc_simple_cql,Simple CQL>> clause specifies the use of the `INTERSECTS`
spatial operator.  This requirement adds additional Dimensionally Extended
Nine-intersection Model (DE-9IM) relation operators to the list of spatial
operators that an implementation of this extension might offer.

include::requirements/enhanced-spatial-operators/REQ_enhanced-spatial-operators.adoc[]

NOTE: The spatial predicates currently use a different pattern than the
comparison and temporal predicates and are written like function calls.
This difference is inherited from previous versions of CQL. This is an open
issue: Whether this version of CQL used in the OGC API - Features - Part 3 
standard should change the spatial predicates to be consistent with the other
predicates or to keep the legacy because of existing CQL implementations.
Comments are welcome in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/493[GitHub issue] on this topic.

The following table lists the mathematical definitions of each spatial operator
as described in <<ogc06-103r4,OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information - Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>.

[[temporal-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Temporal Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_temporal-operators.adoc[]

A temporal predicate evaluates two time-valued expressions to determine, if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified temporal operator.

The operands in a temporal predicate are temporal geometries. A temporal geometry is either an instant or an interval.

An instant is either a date or a timestamp in accordance with <<rfc3339,RFC 3339>> (rules `full-date` or `date-time`). Note that since time is continuous, every instant has a duration and a start/end. Nevertheless, the geometry can be considered an instant in the temporal resolution that is applicable for the specific property.

An interval is the time between a start instant and an end instant, including both bounding instances.

Depending on the implementation environment, the underlying datastore may or may not support intervals as data types of properties. If not, intervals are typically represented by two separate properties that are instants, one for the start and one for the end of the interval.

All temporal geometries are in the Gregorian Calendar. This is a deliberate restriction to keep implementations of CQL simple, avoiding requirements to transform time instants to other temporal coordinate reference systems, but still cover a large number of use cases. This is consistent with the use of RFC 3339 as a key standard for expressing date and time on the internet, including in the OGC API standards.

The temporal operators in CQL are based on the definitions in the <<owl-time,W3C/OGC Time Ontology in OWL>>. 

The following table specifies the definition of the temporal operators where both operands may be instants or intervals, including mixed combinations.
