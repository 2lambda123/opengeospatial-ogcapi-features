[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web API
in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the
API building blocks.

OGC API Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query
features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts, each
of them is a separate standard.

A fundamental operation performed on a collection of resources is that of
querying in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains resource
instances that satisfy some filtering criteria.  This part, part 4, defines
an encoding for specifying enhanced filtering criteria in a request to a server,
beyond what is supported in the core called the  `Common Query Language`.

The common query language defined in this document is used to specify how
resource instances in a source collection should be filter to identify a
result set.  Typically, CQL is used in query operations to identify the
subset of resources that should be included in a response document.
However, CQL may also be used in other operations (e.g. updates) to
identify the subset of resources that  should be affected by an operation.

Each resource instance in the source collection is evaluated using a filtering
expression encoded using the common query language.  The overall filter
expression always evaluates to `true` or `false`.  If the expression evaluates
to true, the resource instance satisfies the expression and is marked as being
in the result set. If the overall filter expression evaluates to false, the data
instance is not in the result set.  Thus, the net effect of evaluating a filter
expression is a set of resources that satisfy the predicates in the expression.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the nth part of the OGC API - Features standards. This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
