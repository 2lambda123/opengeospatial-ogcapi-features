[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API - Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query
features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts. Each
part is a separate standard.

A fundamental operation performed on a <<collection-def,collection>> of features is that of
filtering in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains feature
instances that satisfy some filtering criteria.  Part three of the OGC API - Feature Standard defines

* Query parameters (`filter`, `filter-lang`, `filter-crs`) to specify filter
criteria in a request to an API;
* A filter grammar called Common Query Language (CQL) for specifying enhanced
filtering criteria beyond what is supported in the Core;
* Two encodings for CQL - a text and a JSON encoding.

The Common Query Language (CQL) defined in this document is a generic filter
grammar that can be used to specify how <<resource-def,resource>> instances in a source
collection of any item type, including features, can be filtered to identify
a results set. Typically, CQL is used in query operations to identify the
subset of resources, such as features, that should be included in a response
document. However, CQL can also be used in other operations, such as updates,
to identify the subset of resources that should be affected by an operation.

Each resource instance in the source collection is evaluated against a filtering
expression. The filter expression always evaluates to `true` or `false`. If the
expression evaluates to `true`, the resource instance satisfies the expression and
is marked as being in the result set. If the overall filter expression evaluates
to `false`, the data instance is not in the result set.  Thus, the net effect of
evaluating a filter expression is a set of resources that satisfy the <<predicate-def,predicates>>
in the expression.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of part three (3) of the OGC API - Features standard.
This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
