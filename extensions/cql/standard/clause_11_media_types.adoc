[[mediatypes]]
== Media Types

See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>, Clause 10.

NOTE: Currently, there have not been plans to register media types for the CQL encodings. The reason is the assumption that filter expressions as such will rarely be used as
requests or responses, but usually be part of a request or response and be embedded in it. If you have use cases where a CQL media type would be important, please consider adding a comment in https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/467[this GitHub issue].
