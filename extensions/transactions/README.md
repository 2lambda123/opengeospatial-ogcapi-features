# Transaction Extensions (simple & complex)

This folder contains the content for:

* OGC API - Features - Part n: Simple Transactions
* OGC API - Features - Part n: Complex Transactions

Right now the only file is "TX_Notes.adoc" which is a fairly detailed description of how simple and complex transactions might work.

I have added two subdirectories, "simple" and "complex" where the content
for each extension would live.

All this, of course, is preliminary and is subject to change without notice.
