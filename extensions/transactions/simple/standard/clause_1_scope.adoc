== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behaviour of a server that supports
simple transactions.

Simple transactions are transactions that add, replace, modify or delete
individual features from a single feature collection.

Additional parts to <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>> will
subsequently be specified to handle complex transactions; that is transactions
that require batch or atomic semantics.

Specifically, this document specifies:

* How to add a new feature instance to a feature collection.

* How to modify an existing feature from a collection; this includes entirely replacing the existing feature or simply modifying a part of a feature.

* How to remove an existing feature from a collection.
