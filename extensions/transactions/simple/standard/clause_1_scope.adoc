== Scope

This document specifies an extension that defined the behaviour of a server
that supports simple transactions.  Simple transactions are transactions that
add, replace, modify or delete individual resources from a single collection.

Additional specifications will subsequently be created to handle complex
transactions; that is transactions that require batch or atomic semantics.

Specifically, this document specifies:

* How to add a new resource instance to a collection.

* How to modify an existing resource from a collection; this includes entirely replacing the existing resource or simply modifying one or more parts of a
resource.

* How to remove an existing resource from a collection.
