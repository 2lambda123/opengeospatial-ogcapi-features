== Security Considerations

See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>, Clause 11.

Users making modifications to resources need to:

. be authenticated

. have "modification privileges" on one or more of the resource collections offered by the API

. have access to one or more of the POST, PUT, PATCH and/or DELETE methods

The specific priviledges that a user posessed need to be reflected in the resource paths and available methods described in the API document.
