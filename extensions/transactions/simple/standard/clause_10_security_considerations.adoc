== Security Considerations

See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>, Clause 11.

Since CREATE, REPLACE, DELETE and UPDATE operations will change the resources 
and not "just" query them, servers will in almost all cases restrict the 
access to these operations.

Users making modifications to resources need to:

. be authenticated,

. have "modification privileges" on one or more of the resource collections offered by the API,

. have access to one or more of the POST, PUT, PATCH and/or DELETE methods on the resources / resource endpoints.

The API definition has to reflect this in the resource paths and their available methods.
